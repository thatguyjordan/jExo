Most of these items are:
Planned items that have no use.
Items that have unimplemented uses that weren't able to make to release.
Items that will most likely not have uses, but we'll keep them in this folder just incase we need them.

Why is this in my download?
Either you downloaded;
The Beta/Dev Version
Or
Someone messed up on release.
You're looking at the github.
