Honing is a system at the endgame of jExo to heavily improve your weapons and armour, making them viable in the endgame, and allowing a final bit of customization to you exo equipment.

Honed equipment can not be recycled, cannot have additional upgrades added, and cannot be honed again. When honing you have a choice of three different things, improving certain aspects of that piece of equipment.

Armour:

Hone for 
Defence (Improving the users overall defence, and improving upgrades that are considered to be defencive (Knockback res, Lava charm, etc.))

Offence (Increases the users overall attack power, as well as improving upgrades that are considered to be offencive (Improved magic, ranged, or melee damage, melee speed, aggro count, etc.)) 

Utility (Improves the overall defence and attack of the user slightly, as well as buffing up upgrades that are more utility (Number of jumps, spelunker, night vision, mana reduction, etc.))

Minigun:

Hone for

Frenzy (For those who like a rambo playstyle, heavily decreases accuracy, however increases Shot speed, chance to not consume ammo, slightly decreases damage.)

Accuracy (More like the sniper rifle, Heavily decreases shot speed, but increases damage, accuracy and crit chance)

Special (Increases everything slightly, as well as improving the upgrades that are strange (Multiple shot, frag shot, Etemental, etc))

Not sure if this goes against the plans you had previously for improving upgrades. But whatever, I just kind of made this up on the spot
